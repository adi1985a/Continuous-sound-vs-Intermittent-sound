## üìÑ Overview

**VCL AudioPlayer Demo**, developed by Adrian Lesniak, is a C++ application built using Borland C++ Builder and its Visual Component Library (VCL). This program serves as a practical demonstration of two distinct methods for playing audio files on Windows:
1.  **Synchronous Playback**: Utilizing the `TMediaPlayer` VCL component.
2.  **Asynchronous Playback**: Employing the WinAPI function `sndPlaySound` from `mmsystem.h`.
The application features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) with dedicated buttons to trigger each playback method. It also handles the loading of the audio file (`snd/dzwiek.wav`) upon form creation and ensures proper resource cleanup when the form is closed.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Playback Methods

*   <0xF0><0x9F><0xAA><0xBD> **MediaPlayer Playback (Synchronous)**:
    *   Triggered by `Button1`.
    *   Uses `MediaPlayer1->Play()` to start playback.
    *   The audio file plays to completion, and subsequent clicks on the button during playback typically have no effect until the current playback finishes (behavior characteristic of synchronous or managed playback).
*   üîä **`sndPlaySound` Playback (Asynchronous by Default)**:
    *   Triggered by `Button2`.
    *   Uses the `sndPlaySound` function with the `SND_ASYNC` flag.
    *   Playback starts immediately and can be interrupted/restarted by subsequent clicks on the button. The application continues to respond during playback.
    *   *(Note: The description mentions an optional `SND_SYNC` mode, which would make `sndPlaySound` behave synchronously, queuing clicks for sequential playback if the sound isn't already playing.)*
*   üñ•Ô∏è **VCL Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
    *   A main form (`TForm`) hosts the interactive elements.
    *   `Button1`: Labeled for MediaPlayer playback.
    *   `Button2`: Labeled for `sndPlaySound` playback.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Form Event Handling**:
    *   `FormCreate`: Automatically loads and opens the specified audio file (`snd/dzwiek.wav`) for the `TMediaPlayer` component when the application starts.
    *   `FormClose`: Properly closes the `TMediaPlayer` component to release associated system resources when the application window is closed.
*   üéµ **Audio File Dependency**:
    *   The application is hardcoded to look for an audio file named `dzwiek.wav` located in a subfolder named `snd` (i.e., `snd/dzwiek.wav`) relative to the executable's path.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

*   **Development Environment**: Borland C++ Builder (specific version compatible with the VCL components and project files used).
*   **Operating System**: Windows (due to heavy reliance on VCL, `mmsystem.h`, and `sndPlaySound` WinAPI).
*   **Required Libraries/Headers**:
    *   `<vcl.h>` (Borland VCL core)
    *   `<mmsystem.h>` (Windows Multimedia API for `sndPlaySound`)
    *   `<iostream>` (if used for any console debugging, though primarily a GUI app)
*   **Local Asset**: The audio file `snd/dzwiek.wav` must be present in the correct subfolder.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup in Borland C++ Builder

1.  **Clone or Obtain Project Files**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` and `<repository-directory>` if applicable, or simply ensure all project files are in a single directory.)*

2.  **Prepare Audio Asset**:
    *   Create a subfolder named `snd` within your project's main directory (or where the final executable will reside).
    *   Place the audio file `dzwiek.wav` inside this `snd` subfolder.

3.  **Project Files**:
    *   **`Unit1.cpp`**: This file should contain the C++ source code with the event handler implementations for `FormCreate`, `FormClose`, `Button1Click`, and `Button2Click`.
    *   **`Unit1.dfm`**: This is the Borland VCL form file that defines the GUI layout and component properties (e.g., `TMediaPlayer` named `MediaPlayer1`, `TButton` named `Button1`, `TButton` named `Button2`). This file is typically managed by the C++ Builder IDE's Form Designer. Ensure it contains:
        *   A `TMediaPlayer` component (e.g., named `MediaPlayer1`).
        *   Two `TButton` components (e.g., named `Button1` and `Button2`).
        *   The `OnClick` events for the buttons and the `OnCreate` and `OnClose` events for the form must be linked to their respective C++ handler functions in `Unit1.cpp`.

4.  **Open and Compile in Borland C++ Builder**:
    *   Open the project file (e.g., `*.bpr` or `*.cbproj` depending on the C++ Builder version) in the Borland C++ Builder IDE.
    *   Use the IDE‚Äôs "Build" or "Make" command to compile the project.
    *   Use the IDE's "Run" command to execute the application.

    *Alternatively, if compiling manually (less common for VCL projects without a makefile):*
    ```bash
    bcc32 Unit1.cpp # This is a simplified example and might require linking VCL libraries.
    ```
    *Manual compilation of VCL applications is complex and typically handled by the IDE's build system.*

## üí° Usage Guide

1.  Build and run the application from within the Borland C++ Builder IDE or by executing the compiled `.exe` file (ensure `snd/dzwiek.wav` is correctly placed).
2.  **Interface**:
    *   A simple window will appear, containing two buttons (e.g., "Play with MediaPlayer" and "Play with sndPlaySound").
3.  **Actions**:
    *   **Click Button1 (MediaPlayer)**: The audio file `dzwiek.wav` will begin playing. It will play to completion. Clicking this button again while the sound is playing will likely have no immediate effect on the ongoing playback.
    *   **Click Button2 (`sndPlaySound`)**: The audio file `dzwiek.wav` will begin playing asynchronously. If you click this button again while the sound is playing, the sound will typically restart from the beginning.
4.  **Close the Form**:
    *   Closing the application window will trigger the `FormClose` event, which should properly release resources used by `MediaPlayer1`.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

*   `Unit1.cpp`: The main C++ source file containing the implementation for the form's event handlers and logic.
*   `Unit1.h`: (Implicitly generated by C++ Builder) The header file for `Unit1.cpp`, declaring the form class and its components.
*   `Unit1.dfm`: The Borland VCL form file, defining the GUI layout and properties of components. This is typically edited visually in the IDE.
*   `snd/dzwiek.wav`: The audio file required for playback.
*   `[ProjectName].bpr` or `[ProjectName].cbproj`: The Borland C++ Builder project file.
*   `README.md`: This documentation file.

## üìù Technical Notes

*   **Windows-Specific**: This application is fundamentally Windows-specific due to its reliance on the Borland VCL framework and the Windows Multimedia API (`mmsystem.h` for `sndPlaySound`). Adapting it for other platforms would require a complete rewrite using a cross-platform GUI toolkit and audio library.
*   **Component Configuration**: The correct functioning of the application heavily depends on the `Unit1.dfm` file having the `TMediaPlayer` (named `MediaPlayer1`) and `TButton` components correctly placed and their events linked to the handlers in `Unit1.cpp`.
*   **Audio File Path**: The path `ExtractFilePath(Application->ExeName) + "snd\\dzwiek.wav"` is used to locate the audio file. This ensures it looks for the `snd` folder in the same directory as the executable.
*   **Error Handling**: The provided code snippet focuses on playback. Robust error handling (e.g., checking if `dzwiek.wav` exists and can be opened, handling `sndPlaySound` return values) would be important in a production application.
*   **Comments**: The original code description mentions Polish comments. While the functionality is described in English, the source code itself might contain comments in Polish.
